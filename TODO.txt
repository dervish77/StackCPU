TODO - StackCPU
===============

- Specify requirements
-- not yet specified

- Implementation of SW simulator
-- disable debug statements DONE
-- add status output when call of "instruction cycle" completes DONE
-- move unit.bin to test.bin DONE
-- modify SER and PRT instructions as follows
   -- have PRT output to prt.txt file
   -- have SER input from ser.txt file
   -- will need to add options to cmd line in main.c, and add methods
   to uiSim and coreSim to handle the file pointers (alternative is use a
   uartDevice class that has internal in/out buffers instead of actual files)
   -- add -p and -q CLI commands to display ser and prt files/buffers
-- code coverage
   -- add code coverage to makefile DONE
   -- add -u option to main.cpp DONE
   -- add unit test hooks into uiSim and coreSim DONE
   -- test and improve code coverage as needed
   -- create new unit.bin to use each valid opcode

- Implementation of assembler tools
-- not yet started
